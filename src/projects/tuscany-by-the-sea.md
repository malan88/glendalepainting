Tuscany by the Sea is an old world style waterfront condominium complex comprised of just 11 residences on Indian Shores Beach in Florida. This building had some real rigging challenges and was quite fun.  The board selected a drastic color change on this building and boy did it make a difference.  A truly great looking building indeed.
