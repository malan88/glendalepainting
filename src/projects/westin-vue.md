Located in Downtown Sarasota

One of our larger new construction projects to date, the Westin/VUE mixed use
project is located on the waterfront in Downtown Sarasota.  One portion of the
project is an 18 story Westin Hotel and the other an 18 story high end
condominium.  The site also included an 8 story podium garage.  Our scope of
work included complete waterproofing of the exterior all beauty bead sealants,
epoxy wall coatings, extensive wallcovering installation of standard
wallcoverings as well as specialty ones, including murals.

The project took 28,000 gallons of paint (158 tons worth), 18,000 yards of
wallcovering (180 football fields in length) and 82,000 man hours.
