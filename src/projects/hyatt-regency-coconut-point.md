After dark, the lighting scheme of the 18 story building's four caps is a
landmark across Estero Bay.

The resort offers over 73,000 square feet of meeting space with 454 guestrooms
with views of the Bay. This high-rise high-end resort is centrally located
between Naples and Fort Myers immediately to the north of Pelican Landing.

We painted this property in 2001. It was our first bonded project.
