quote: ["The building repairs and painting was performed in a professional manner, site cleanup was done on a continual basis, all workers were properly attired while performing their duties and maintained a professional demeanor while working in close proximity to our residents. The project has been completed and has been receiving positive comments from residents and neighboring residents alike.

The cooperation between the Property Manager, Glendale Supervision and Board of Directors was excellent. The spalling concrete and stucco repairs were all completed and, when change orders were needed, communication was timely and allowed for all to assess the needed repair and make informed decisions on the course of action to be taken.", "Linda Kobbe - LCAM on behalf of the Board of Directors - Gulf Island Beach & Tennis Club"]
