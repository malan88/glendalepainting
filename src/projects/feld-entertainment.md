Feld Entertainment relocated its International Headquarters to this large half a million square foot industrial facility.  The developer and builder hired us for the painting of new corporate offices to be built at the front of the building.  The scope also included a couple hundred thousand square feet of floor coatings.  The cleaning and painting of the structural steel in two large warehouse bays where future rehearsals would take place.  In short it was a fun project with lots of different things going on.
