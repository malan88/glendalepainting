Managed by Presbyterian Homes and Housing, Lakeland Presbyterian Apartments is a high rise apartment building dedicated to compassion and concern for older adults on the West Coast of Florida.

The atmosphere provides independent living with dignity and well-being. PHHF hired Glendale because of our reputation working around seniors. We don't hurry. We don't use foul language. Our employees are courteous and respectful of every resident. When questioned, which is inevitable, responses are gracious, well spoken and informative, leaving the resident feeling they are part of the process and having pride in the building they live in.
