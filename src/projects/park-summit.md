Park Summit is a premier continuing care rental retirement community, offering independent living, assisted living, rehabilitation, skilled nursing care, and seasonal and guest stays.

Marriott managed this facility and hired Glendale to perform standard restoration services to some failing stucco and concrete as well as recaulk, seal and paint the entire property.

Marriott had faith in Glendale for this delicate work because of the care our employees and management take when working along side seniors.

The project took 75 days from start to completion. Leaving the site was difficult for a few residents who liked to talk with a couple of our workers to get their morning updates. We, too, were sorry to leave.

Maintenance painting is more than a construction service. It's relationship building, knowledge and professionalism as well.
