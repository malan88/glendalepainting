Echelon brings to this location a $50 million high rise. This condominium is set
for 18 floors, 15 of which are full-floor residential units designed with floor
areas of 4,155 square feet each.

Echelon includes a half-floor unit with a living area of 3,079 square feet and a
two-level 4,381-square-foot townhouse with a walk-up access to Gulfstream
Avenue. 

Our scope of work included painting, beauty bead sealant installation, and some
waterproofing.  The project exterior was a bit more difficult because of the
zero lot line for the building.  Rigging was a challenge in some areas.
