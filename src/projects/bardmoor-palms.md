Formerly the corporate HQ for Eckerd Drug, Harrod Properties purchased the
property in 2006 and completed a $30 million rehabilitation and expansion of the
complex.

This project consisted of new construction phases as well as repaint and
waterproofing work.  Stair membrane systems were replaced as well as new
expansion joints.
