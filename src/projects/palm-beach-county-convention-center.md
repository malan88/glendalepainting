The Palm Beach County Convention Center was built by Clark Construction of
Bethesda Maryland. One of the worlds largest builders with extensive experience
in this type of work. The $83-million, 350,000-square-foot Convention Center
opened its doors in January 2004 in the booming downtown district of West Palm
Beach, Fla. The state-of-the-art facility features a 100,000-square-foot exhibit
hall, a 25,000-square-foot ballroom, 23,000 square feet of flexible breakout
space divisible into 23 rooms, expert service teams and an award-winning
culinary department.

Glendale’s scope of work was as diverse as the conventions the facility houses.
There was extensive specialty wallcovering, Duraplex finishes, epoxies,
insulating coatings, etc. The décor included aprox 127 colors and products to
track.
