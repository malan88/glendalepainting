The Bay Mariner Condo condo in INDIAN SHORES was built in 1974.  With a very active board, they stay on top of these buildings.  From the mural when you drive up to the quality of the paint systems, these people want it done right.  It's not to often that a customer wants TWO coats of finish over a primer.  These folks took the advice of the manufacturer to make sure their building looks good for many many years to come.

Not many property managers or boards realize that adding another whole coat of finish doesn't raise the price of the paint job as much as you would think.
