In the heart of Florida's Gold Coast, along Pompano Beach in Fort Lauderdale,
this 18 story gem required interior and exterior painting, beauty bead sealants
and floor coatings as well as some Faux finishing in the amenity areas.

This was an amenity rich building, where the only application challenge was
keeping our men on the east side of the building focused on their work rather
than on the deep blue beauty of the Atlantic one block away.
