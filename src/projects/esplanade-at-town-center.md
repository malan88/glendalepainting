Esplanade at Town Center is a new living concept unlike any other in North Florida. Enjoy a gated community with an urban flair where shopping, restaurants, and entertainment venues are within walking distance from your home. Resort-style amenities include gated access, swimming pool, built-in elevators, and private community parking garage.

Esplanade at Town Center is located in area's most sought-after shopping and dining establishments inside the St. Johns Town Center. Glendale was brought in by Wood Partners to repaint the fairly new property due to failures with the original painter.
