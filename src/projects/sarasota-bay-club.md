This was a large project consisting of two towers, a connector building and 4 other structures.  It was colored EIFS.  Pressure washing was required twice a year to remove mildew.  It was decided that painting to seal the surface porosity would resist dirt & mildew more than the porous unpainted EIFS. This first paint job was a three coat system with a high build as an intermediate coat for added sealing.
