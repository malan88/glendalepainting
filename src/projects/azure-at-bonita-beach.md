Azure is a 25 story residential tower along with eight street front carriage
homes located in Bonita Bay. The luxury high-rise offers views over mangrove
preserves, Estero Bay, and the Gulf of Mexico. The tower's modern, Mediterranean
style exterior design is typical of Bonita Bay Group's high-rises. The tower
contains units of 3,400 to 4,200 square feet, and eight carriage homes ranging
from 2,700 to 3,200 square feet.

As one of the projects we are most proud of, the work included bead blasting a
two story underground parking garage floor to be recoated with Epoxy. As we find
on many of our projects, rigging required a little thought process here as well.
Azure serves as one of our signature properties.
