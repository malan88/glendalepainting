The multiple colors needed as well as the rigging challenges required made Aria
a fun project from an applicators stand point.

Aria is an 18 story luxury high rise tower located on Park Shore Beach in North
Naples, one of the most prestigious addresses in the world. The property was
developed by the Lutgert Group, one of the premier high end developers in the
nation.
