Buildings like Beacon don't compete well in an environment surrounded by new structures unless they maintain theirs to a high degree.  The Beacon management new this and were anxious to rehabilitate their building and parking garage and change the color scheme to fit the trends.  After restoring over 1,000 cubic feet of concrete and replacing 14,000 square feet of stucco, Beacon is once again a shining property the residents can be proud of again.
