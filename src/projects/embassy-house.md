Embassy House is an older established Condominium High Rise in the heart of
Downtown Sarasota.  The work consisted of refinishing all the aluminum window
frames, doors and rails.  We also repaired deteriorated concrete, replaced
delaminated stucco, removed and reinstalled the waterproof parking deck system,
replaced broken screen block in the front of the building as well as repairing
some structural wall defects.

Embassy House is the southernmost condominium located near what we like to call
“Marina Row.” Located at 770 South Palm Avenue, this 69-unit building has been
part of the Sarasota downtown scene since 1975.
