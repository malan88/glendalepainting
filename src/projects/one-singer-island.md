One Singer Island condos is an oceanfront community in Singer Island, offering
panoramic views of ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway. 

It's amazing, sometimes, as a painter, to be able to work in a building like
this. The views are killer. It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase our
painters greet each other with almost every day: "Another day in paradise."
