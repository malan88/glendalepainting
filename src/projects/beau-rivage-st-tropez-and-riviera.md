These 3 high rise buildings are located in Fort Myers. Beau Rivage was the first
building of the three that we painted in 2004. There are 124 luxury condominiums
along with an adjacent 3-story parking garage with private parking, a gated
entrance, concierge service, fitness center with pool and spa, tennis courts,
riverside cabanas and separate guest suites for short-term stays.

The property was developed by Homes for America Holding, Inc. They were the
first hi-rise Condominium buildings in Ft. Myers in some 30 yrs.
